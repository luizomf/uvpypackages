# Python Packages Monorepo: Educational Python Projects with uv

This repository serves as an **educational monorepo**, housing various Python
projects developed for programming tutorials and lessons (e.g., on Udemy and
YouTube). Its primary goal is to provide well-structured, practical examples of
modern Python development practices.

## Project Structure

The monorepo is organized by **topics**, with each major project residing in its
own root-level directory. This approach allows for easy navigation and the clear
separation of distinct learning modules.

### Current Projects

**`namespaces/`**: This directory contains a comprehensive example demonstrating
the implementation of **Python Namespace Packages** within a **`uv` Workspace**.
It showcases how to structure multiple Python packages that share a common
top-level namespace, managed efficiently by `uv`.

[Here is the lesson in video for that project.](https://youtu.be/sn3DUtAIcG8)

## Getting Started

To explore a specific project, navigate into its respective directory (e.g.,
`cd namespaces`). Each project folder contains its own `README.md` with detailed
instructions on setup, usage, and specific concepts demonstrated.

## Contribution and Updates

This monorepo is designed to reflect the state of code as presented in
accompanying tutorials. Therefore, direct modifications to existing code are
kept to a minimum to maintain consistency. Updates primarily focus on
documentation and ensuring compatibility with current tool versions.
